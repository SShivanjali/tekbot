🎨 Frontend Development

Frontend is the graphical user interface (GUI) that users see and interact with.

🧱 Core Technologies:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of web interfaces.

⚙️ Web Frameworks & Libraries:

For complex applications: Angular, React.js, Vue.js

React is currently leading in popularity, though Vue and Angular have their strengths.

📱 Mobile-First & Cross-Platform Frameworks:

For mobile and tablet UI: React Native, Cordova, Ionic, Framework7, Xamarin, Flutter, Native Script

These enable development of cross-platform (Android & iOS) apps with a single codebase.

🚀 Evolution of Frontend:

Earlier: Logic handled mostly by backend (PHP, .NET, Java, Python, etc.)

Now: Frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) paired with backend REST APIs

Advantages include better performance, flexibility, and speed.

✅ Benefit:

Modern frontend technologies allow for rich, responsive applications executed in the browser.

Cross-platform mobile frameworks are now powerful and widely adopted.
